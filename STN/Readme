My Running Environment is: Tensorflow-GPU-1.4, Python-2.7.12

1. You can run this code by inputing: python main.py. The results should be close to 93.03 (C->A) and 93.11 (W->A), respectively. Note that different environmental outputs may be different.

2. You can use your datasets by replacing: 
   source_exp = [ad.SCS, ad.SWS]  % source domain data
   target_exp = [ad.TAD, ad.TAD]  % target domain data

3. You can tune the parameters, i.e., beta, lr, T, d, tau, for different applications.

4. The default parameters are: beta = 0.001, lr = 0.001, T = 300, d = 256, tau = 0.001.
